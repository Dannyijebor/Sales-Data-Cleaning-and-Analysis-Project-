# **Sales Data Cleaning and Analysis Project 🚀**  

## **Overview**  
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a sales dataset for analysis. The dataset includes transaction records across multiple countries, customer segments, and product categories. The goal was to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and readiness for insights generation.  

## **📌 Key Data Cleaning Steps**  
- ✅ **Handled Missing Values** – Checked and addressed inconsistencies.  
- ✅ **Standardized Data Formats** – Ensured uniformity in date formats, numerical values, and text fields.  
- ✅ **Removed Duplicates** – Eliminated redundant records for accurate analysis.  
- ✅ **Corrected Errors** – Fixed inconsistencies in product names, sales figures, and country labels.  
- ✅ **Enhanced Readability** – Reformatted column names and structured data for better usability.  

## **🔍 Insights & Results**

📊 **Sales performance by region and customer segment**  
📊 **Profitability trends and cost analysis**  
📊 **Monthly and yearly revenue trends**  
📊 **Top-performing product categories**  

## **🛠 Tools Used**
